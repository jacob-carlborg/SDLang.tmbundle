# TextMate Bundle for SDLang

This is a TextMate bundle with support for syntax highlighting of
[SDLang](http://sdlang.org/) documents. SDLang is a simple declarative language
with a lean syntax and an XML-like structure.

This TextMate bundle is a port from the
[Sublime Text package](https://github.com/s-ludwig/sublime-sdlang).

## Install

```
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
